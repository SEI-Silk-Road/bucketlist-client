## Reach Goals

Integrate with a third-party location-based API to:
  * allow users to search for a location or  venue to add to their bucket list items.
  * autofill an input field.
  * drop pins on a map.

Add social features to our site, such as following other users.
Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.
Allow users to upload an image when they complete an item.
